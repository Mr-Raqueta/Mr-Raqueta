- ğŸ‘‹ Hii, Iâ€™m @Mr-Raqueta
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in... idk just learning stuff 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning _**C**_, not _C#_, not __C++__. I'm completely serious, I'm by no means a programmer nor I try to be one
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: please don't
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am an indecisive fivehead who'd spend hours (4 by the time of finishing this) just to decide what to write in my github bio
